# Using Navigator

### Starting Navigator

Anaconda Navigator can be found on Launchpad \(Mac\) or start menu \(Windows\). Homepage displays applications, which can installed and then launched. We will be using Jupyter Notebook \(an interactive computational environment that is great for displaying code & results\) and Spyder \(Python IDE\) in this class.
