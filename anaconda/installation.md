# Getting started

### Anaconda installers

Select the appropriate installer for your operating system from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and then follow the instructions to install it on your computer.

_Fun fact: Anaconda was developed by Peter Wang, a Cornell alumnus. Got to meet him on campus, which was super cool!_

### Miniconda installers

If you are concerned about the size of Anaconda, you can install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) instead. Miniconda only includes the basics, such as Python and conda, so you must install other packages by yourself.
